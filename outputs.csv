19072,0,"computers, and computer networks, all are designed to carry out several functions which differ only in degree. A single application can run on a computer program or on multiple other computers.
In computing, a machine is any software program that can take up a specific amount of time to complete a task. A system that manages a program is called a “program”. Computer programming is the application of mathematics, which deals with solving a problem. The computer program executes the program in hardware devices that convert information they have received into code which is programmed to run the program. Such computer programming programs are usually called programming languages.
Computer program systems vary greatly and can be as simple as a word processor or as complex as a piece of software that was written in a particular programming language. A computer program is typically written in a high level language or application which is more complex but requires more computer processing power. While a computer program may be considered a single-user software program, it can operate alongside many components.
Many modern computer operating systems use the Open source code library called C, which contains the computer software, the operating system, and the operating system, so that a computer program can be built on the operating system. Most other software programs are written in the .NET programming language.
In contrast, the original Macintosh OS and Macintosh computers used the C programming language, but developed in the 1980s. The modern computer architecture incorporates numerous open source components and many other features. The most important of these are the operating system, which includes program files and databases, which use the data structures of an operating system together. A typical software program is described in the following way:
This is the basic information, in computer terminology, that a program contains to help the programmer achieve an operation.
The computer language, the language of programs, usually the language of a particular software program, and in computer hardware, the language of the computer hardware, is sometimes called a hardware language. It is sometimes written as part of the package.
All computers use the term hardware to refer to the computer device that contains information needed to run a program. When a computer system refers to ""processing operations,"" the name is generally to distinguish it from other devices having ""processing functions."" ""Processing"" is used to describe the ""function of"" or ""source operand,"" the ""input device"" associated with a program instruction.
The computer program is often divided into two parts: the ""input"" part and the ""output"" part. The word ""input"" generally refers to a word or phrase that appears right after a particular instruction, or a statement containing any special kind of information.
The computer program in which the information can be stored, usually in memory, is the ""input"" part; if the data used for input devices is not contained it is called ""output"". An example of an output device is one or more ""files"" of information stored within (or downloaded onto) a computer. Most computers use one of these files to store data at a later time. The data, sometimes called the processor, is the main memory of the computer.
Another common type of data stored in memory is the ""output"". The data in memory is the data that needs to be stored so that the data can be processed.
One of the most important features of the computer system is that the computer's operating system is designed to deal with several separate software programs working together.
In computers, the programs execute the same commands as they were intended to do. This is not often the case in some other system; programs may be called ""executable"" programs. The names of these programs vary in appearance. For instance, a system may call it ""program m"" or ""program m"" which, if you use ""m"" as the program name, means a program being executed by a program. The name of the ""program"" is sometimes changed in order to make it harder for a computer program to be read and executed.
If the term ""program"", which means a set of instructions to be executed at one or more different times each call of the operating system, is to be followed, it does not include the software in the operating system.<|endoftext|>The following is a condensed version of the article, a copy is not included.
How could it be that you would not have heard of it if there were no people who were at war in the past?
As we have said earlier, the answer lies in the early 1930s. From an early age, William Hershey's ""Winnie the Riveter"" was his favorite toy. It was an ordinary doll, often found to be a few hundred pounds in value, and he toyed with it a lot. At that time, Hershey was the number one player for the ""Winnie the Riveter"" and he was even named the ""King of Small Game"". By 1937 a number of other children's toys had been created.

19072,1,"computers. We call this “prefect” processing that occurs with supercomputers, computers with an “expert” (“T”) role that allows them to analyze large quantities of information and solve problems faster than an average person can.
In this report, we analyze the differences between people that have a computer system on their desk or at the checkout counter by providing a list of “T” roles played by computers that were assigned for them to use in processing large amounts of information. Computer operators were asked to “perform” the tasks because they are not computer operations because the T role is played by humans that don’t have a computer. The role of computer operators refers to a system, a language, or a database the T operator performs, in order for computer operators to use computers that have a T role in processing large volumes of information while making decisions that can affect the “precedents, results and consequences” (Wachs and Shackelman, 2001 ) .
In addition to a T-SQL database, Figure 2-7 presents the table of examples reported in the book-based database of IBM (the database was created by the IT department in 1988 and was based on the IBM Business Machines Program (BIP) . This table allows users to get a sense of the type of information a computer operator can handle. The table also gives an overview of what IBM was designed to do when it came to using computer systems.
A “T-SQL database” consists of two distinct parts: an environment, a database of input and a query language, which is the language of the environment. An “expert” (“T”) role for each computer in the T-SQL database is identified in figure 2-8, and those who use the “expert” role will have to do much more with the database than those who are not experts. The database is designed for users with a T-SQL experience that is not very demanding.
After performing a T-SQL database activity, IBM developed three different types of information sources that the computer operators could use: (1) a “single application-language database” for the processing of large amounts of information and a database of input data, (2) a “multi-application database” for the processing of large sets of information, or (3) a “multi-application database” for the processing of large amounts of input into the machine.
Table 2-8 shows the results of this database usage. The table shows that IBM designed the T-SQL “interactive application-language database” to have a single T-SQL database, where the user can get answers for a variety of data management issues. The “multisource database” is built on the same T-SQL data model described in Figure 2-5, where the user can access several data sets at once using different data source. For example, using a multisource database you can use the IBM T-SQL “user” (i.e. user of “users”).
For example, if a user needs to input the name of a person but can’t figure out the correct job, then a “user” may have to start by looking up a few data titles, which is called a “t” input. The “user’s name” means that computer performs a particular activity, and it can input a “t” input. In the “user’s database” the user can add “a T” input to each data-set, and the T-SQL “T” input will tell the computer whether the information and output data were input or not. This type of data-set will be used to create a “user’s database” for IBM’s customers, who will use their information for “users’” processing.
However, if the user needs to change the “T” input as the computer becomes more complex, then the computer then will have to perform a second T-SQL database, in which the users input data that are now used for different purposes. The same type of data-set used in the T-SQL database is used by an “interactive application-language database”. Therefore, Figure 2-8 shows that IBM’s “multi-application database” used by IBM customers can be used as a “t” type of T-SQL database and the “t-SQL” types used by IBM’s customer.
With a T-SQL program, the system can perform much, much more quickly, than the computer that created the T-SQL database. This can also be the reason why IBM’s customers can take advantage of the T-SQL"

C# 2 has a special feature - it allows a single-threaded program to run on multiple processors simultaneously.
C# 2 is often the first programming language to use in development as it is simple to create program using a single C++-based programming environment.

Cadmium is one of the most powerful metal alloys, and is the standard component used in medical imaging equipment and medical imaging equipment in all areas of science and medicine.
With the advancement of the world’s technology, medical imaging equipment is the technology that is able to measure the physical effects of various conditions.
How does radium impact medicine?
Radiofloic is a radio frequency radioisotope. Radium emits particles, which have energy ranging from 0.0001 to 10,000 keV, and these particles emit radiation with a specific frequency.
Scientists have found radium in a variety of radioparticle forms (soda-like materials) and in other types of radioparticles in biological cells. Radium atoms are held together by chemical bonds between the oxygen-containing oxygen atoms and the nuclei of the electron shells.
Radiation is classified into three types:
- Radioisotopic: emits high energy radiation at the temperature where it will be absorbed, absorbed, or emitted.
- Radiative: radiates radiation on the order of keV. This is the range we have here in the radioisotopic range.
- Nonradioisotopic: the nonradiative band has low energy energy, but the band range is wider.
Radioisotopic radiation is one of the main causes of ionization in living organisms. There are two main types of radiogenic radiations.
- Short-lived radioisotopic: radiates the radiation emitted by the star, for example, X1.9 – X2.8. It emits high energy radio waves to the surface of the star and is therefore able to have a radiative effect.
Radioisotopic radiative energy is released by radiating the radiation producing ionizations around molecules. These ionized molecules are made of atoms of radiative energy, and because one atom of ionizing radiation is only one atom in its outer shell; there are actually just five electrons in the outer shell of the atom at one moment, and only one electron of that particular energy level does the emission which makes the ionization.
There are various types of radiogenic radiations.
- Radioisotopic ionization (radiation on the order of keV)
- Radiative ionization (radiating the ionization energy at a specific frequency)
- Radiation on the order of keV
The amount of energy that radiates the radioactive ionization increases exponentially as the radioisotopic ionization rate increases. Since we know that a certain energy level cannot be reached at a particular time, radiative ionization is a very important part of the radiative energy.
As is typical for long-lived radioisotopic ionization, the radiation we can observe is short-lived. It is generally used for medical imaging and other medical devices.
For radiative ionization, the amount of radioisotopic energy released by the ionization process greatly depends on the type of radiative ionization.

The most recent addition to the list of ""Internet Protocol stacks"" is IPv6. It means that IPv6 is essentially in the middle of a full-stack stack. There are many ""nodes"" to the IPv6 stack, and the number of computers in the IPv4 stack will be kept fairly close to the number of IPv6 machines that are expected to be used.
We will come to a future post about the IPv4 stack. I also want to bring up another one called IPv6 stack management, just in case you don't read the whole article.
This article was first published 2 years ago. Next up are the links and the comments. Next article is just about the ""stack"" stack. Hopefully I've been missed some things.
I hope you have learned something new to this project and some useful information:
Now you want to find the ""stack"" stack so you can use the IP addresses as your own.
To find the IP address on the top of your stack, follow the link that pops up.
And I just tried to create the IP addresses on the top of my stacks and only found three that were correct. What was wrong?
One of the comments says that the third IP address is incorrect, but the real problem is not the IP.
My question is, what type of address and type should you use? Well, all IP addresses have a ""stack"" that can be used to access the network. There are a lot of IP addresses out there so I couldn't figure it out the hard way.

|Title||Competing methods for the prediction of wind farm performance from the meteorological models used in the model building exercise|

Wind farms have evolved to a huge variety of designs with the growth in capacity over the last 12 years. From a general concept, we discuss the types of wind farms, which can be grouped according to their performance potential and characteristics: “wet farms”, which are wind farms with high potential of generating up to 100%, and “dry farms”, that are wind farms with low potential of generating up to 200%, and “dry”, which are wind farms with low potential of generating up to 50%.
This work provides the first direct evaluation of a new classification based on weather simulation models. The results show that a combination of different wind farms could be used as the most promising wind farms and that other wind farms, which are not currently considered, can be considered as some of the most promising wind farms. The evaluation is based on the available information on experimental wind farms and is based on the simulation data. The conclusions with regard to wind farm performance, which can be divided into three categories:
1. The wind farms are wind-energy generating machines.
2. The wind farms are wind-energy generating machines.
It is evident that in many cases, wind farms are not so promising as that, and the best candidates for the most promising wind farms are the ones which generate up to 100%] and the ones with high output potential (>75%) and whose potential for generating 50%, and which, as mentioned, could be divided in those two categories, are wind-energy generating machines:
a) “dry wind farms” that are wind-energy generators of more than 100% power, but with low potential of generating up to 100%, and the one with high potential of generating up to 20%.
b) “wet wind farms” that are wind-energy generators of 100% power, but with low potential of generating up to 10%. The wind farms with good potential for generating up to 120% power, and the ones with low potential for generating up to 20% power.
These results clearly show that, under suitable conditions, there should be more and better wind farms as a result of more robust studies, improved performance models, and simulation data.<|endoftext|>- About a million years ago, around four billion years ago, Earth’s atmosphere was completely saturated.

The program focuses on the use of green roof solar, which is a form of rooftop solar that harnesses sun energy rather than solar energy directly from the environment.
According to a spokesperson for the university, the program is funded in part through a unique and collaborative process between New Hampshire Universities and Renewable New Hampshire, Inc. This means that the university could begin to use solar energy to support their campus’s green growth projects.
The program is being administered in a collaborative process with a variety of organizations in New Hampshire, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Greening New Hampshire, and USHMM.
The program aims to help universities make a shift in their energy consumption practices from fossil fuels to renewable energy, creating a system where the university can continue to serve as a leader, both economically and environmentally.
“We’re going to be looking at the concept of green energy in the green energy lab, and have a couple of things we are going to provide in the program,” said Amy Schrecken, a researcher at the University’s Center for Sustainable Energy and Climate Change.
“The major component is solar energy, and you also have to consider things like the materials you use and the process of harvesting the sun’s energy.”
Schrecken added that there are several other components of the program, including wind turbine generators, solar panels, battery storage, biofuels and sustainable farming.
The program will use renewable energy, including a program of solar roofing, as it is part of a larger effort as the university has also made it an official part of the renewable energy portfolio they are pursuing to help reduce emissions.
If the initiative reaches its goal, the research team will then be required to provide students and visitors a visual display of the program.

You don’t notice it until you start to fall and that causes pain and muscle tightness especially in the calves, ankles and lower back. The calves provide a safe resting space and support your muscles since they are very short and the body can easily fall off without any warning.
The calves must be warm and moist to keep this from being a common problem. The coldness of the feet often causes aching joints due to the constant cold of the feet.
Your calves also have the ability to be trained for sports and also in sports training to prevent injuries.
In a large group, you can build a team to work with, or work in one. The body’s muscles are not as busy as possible. Each team member is given a specific task for the day in a series of movements and must stay calm and focused until all the muscles have been trained for what they will be doing. Teams are allowed to rotate their teams for specific tasks rather than letting them work solo. If you are a small group you may use this as an opportunity for a few individual work outs before your whole class.
You will need to stretch before each part of your workout. This is a method that is similar to walking, it does not require you to move your body. You will have to keep doing it, or do it.
Once you are completely comfortable with the motion, start to use the stretch, slowly and steadily. Stretching for 10-15 seconds will ensure that muscles start moving the fastest.
Some people find the process to be a little hard to follow, some others need longer stretches of 5-10 seconds. If you start to feel stiff or very sore, that is okay. Your heart will start to take a beating. This is normal stretching if you have a stiff heart.
Your body will continue to recover and use that muscle for the following workouts so make sure you feel well when you do it and you are happy.
After a couple of rounds, get on the bicycle, do a couple of heavy lifting, go up a step and sit down again as usual. After some intervals of 30-60 seconds count over them and try to get as much body into a normal range as possible.
It will not be important if you do this as long as you have a rest. When you go up, do five repetitions and finish that.
The important part of the exercise is that you can stretch for at least 20 seconds at the end of each workout. If you did not stretch at that point think about it and go over it again. Remember that if you were feeling overworked for too long, then you would need a little more stretching to get the muscle back into its active level.<|endoftext|>A new technology is a step closer to the reality in India, where the technology is becoming more advanced.

We see a high prevalence of under-diagnosed and under-treated conditions as well, which is not only due to how popular these diagnoses are, but also the fact that it isn’t a reliable indicator to help in establishing a diagnostic diagnosis as well as a guide for those with a health problem.
So, What is Self-Denial and how does one become a patient of this and why does it still feel so pervasive in public and in this profession?
The Role of the Patient in a Health Problem
Let’s say that you’ve developed a health problem and your doctor thinks your condition is ‘old’ and you’re in an underuse situation. So, it goes to your doctor, who then finds out that you are in a non-healthiest possible spot, where you are. If the answer is ‘no’, then to get your question answered is a major problem in health and is often misdiagnosed, wrongly considered to be a health problem and therefore, unnecessary. So, to get the right treatment to patients who may consider your condition non-healthiest but require self-diagnosis, it is best to do the following:
1. Ask about your symptoms
The more the doctor identifies and addresses the particular problem, the easier it will be for your doctor to diagnose your condition and what can be done to help with that.
There are many different ways by which you can tell about your condition, from observing and looking at your skin, to what sounds and smells you could indicate when you’re in pain, or to be in shock. You might also give a few different names and labels to try to understand what might lie under your skin or why your mind would be racing.
The idea that you are in a ‘safe’ spot, such as a comfortable bed, is very likely to be the most accurate way to look at your skin and see what might be causing its pain and inflammation, but, if your doctor has told you to, you should talk to them about this and have conversations about what you might think might be wrong.
Your blood sugar level is a major indicator of overall health, but it’s still something that can be accurately read with blood sugar readings. For example, just knowing your blood sugar is 95-99.7 doesn’t necessarily mean you are healthy, as many people who have diabetes and high blood pressure are also diagnosed as suffering from diabetes!
2. Make a list of all your symptoms
If your condition involves multiple symptoms, then making a list of their symptoms, as part of a diagnosis can be quite useful as you get into a much better understanding of the cause of your problems, especially with multiple symptoms and their multiple causes so you can make a better prediction of your condition as a patient, and, if not, why?
These lists will help you identify these things and can be applied to other medical conditions too, such as chronic pain. What is the difference between chronic pain and chronic illness with multiple causes?
What is it that makes someone feel sick and how does it affect their health?

When I was younger, my parents were very interested in the history of mankind and the people of the planet.
In a time when the world was being divided between the west and the East, an eye for an eye, eyes that could see the vastness of the land, a very powerful and very wise man, was a great success.
In the days of the Roman Republic, these young people had to go wherever they wanted to join and get jobs, where they could go; they had to write letters and spread the Gospel, go where they wanted to go to.
This was a time of great change in the West and within the Roman Empire. Their influence was immense and made a great big impact on the world. Many events were related and connected to the life of the Romans and this influence continued for centuries.
These new developments changed what became a global issue to many nations and eventually the Roman Republic.
The word ”Rome” itself comes from the Romans.
Here is what I learned today
- The names of some of the early Roman emperors
- How the Romans viewed the world
- The importance of the Roman civilization
What began as a problem for mankind in the early days
- Why did the world change?
- Why did these first Roman citizens have a better chance of finding the world
The Roman Republic didn’t become a democracy
They came back to power and rule
The Roman Empire started crumbling
The power of the empire
How did the first Emperor become a real world problem?
- They looked very different
- They became obsessed with power
- They hated the gods in the temples
- They started a religion
- They started using women
- They grew arrogant
- They were very corrupt and they ran a huge famine
What happened next
The first empire had a lot of problems
The Roman Empire was a lot less powerful for a long time
There were only few things that made the empire so small it took no government at all
What the Romans did
- They began to change their behavior with a kind of democratic government
- They got ideas to change things
- They wanted to get away from the world
- They wanted people to have the better future
- They wanted to rule
- They looked more like kings or priests
For the first emperor of Rome
The First Emperor of Rome
The First Emperor was the greatest emperor of Rome at that time and started a new dynasty.
He kept the empire
He became the leader of the Roman Empire and started the first empire
He went to different places and conquered many people
I don’t know why, but the Roman Republic lasted for many years.
The Roman Republic was an empire for a few centuries

As of 2017, the name of the historic city has been changed to Paris, by the United States Department of Transportation, along with an exhibition and an interactive website at www.marvelmarticar.com
History of Paris
Paris, with an estimated population of 10 million, has been ruled for a very long time by France. It is believed that the origin of the French language dates back to at least the eighth century ce. Paris was originally the French capital city, but it was destroyed and rebuilt several times by the Burgundians in 1066. In the next two centuries, the city would become the capital of the French empire. It became the center for the arts, trade, the sciences, medicine and philosophy. It is now a global city with the second largest urban area in the world.
The city of Paris
France has been a pioneer in world architecture, as it had its own famous landmarks and museums throughout the world. The first landmark to be recognized was the Pyramids of Giza, which were created almost 1,300 years ago. The Pyramids have since been visited by millions of tourists, and are the largest tourist attraction in France.
The first city to have the term Paris was founded in 1139. It became famous in the 18th century when Baron François II (known as France’s founder) constructed a monument designed by the French architect Jean-Louis David in the centre of Paris. France’s greatest architect, Pierre Gros, was the first to build France’s first cathedral, Notre Dame, with Notre Dame being France’s cathedral in the 19th century. France has become a very hot and sunny country,"

“It’s a small book, and you know there are pages in each book and it makes a difference. But, for those that find it hard to put together some of the most compelling information you will ever be able to look at, there is something called an author(s) essay.” – John K. Clements
An author(s) essay is a kind of essay that will give a brief description of an author’s idea and tell you about how you see the author as a character. It is usually done in order to find out what he thinks or why he has been selected as a hero. Usually, authors also put together an outline for their characters. This will be used to give the reader a better sense of what they think about.
However, most authors want an introduction for each character, and each character’s backstory. The author, also known as the story teller, is the one who gets the main idea from the scene, explains the characters’ background, and points out their strengths and weaknesses. A good introduction will also give readers a reason to read it. It should also describe the significance of this moment and the main characters.
Some tips on writing an introduction:
- The introduction has to be short: you can’t write a good introduction.
- The author should explain the significance, but should leave it to chance.
- First, the introduction must cover the topic.
- The introduction should be easy to understand: the writer should explain all the details
- There are two sides to the introduction: the author’s point of view and"

In the beginning you should think about when you are going to introduce a fish to your child. For example: when you first start teaching a fish to preschoolers, or when you are beginning to introduce fish to kindergarteners or kindergartners. While each child wants something different (no pun intended), your child will be sure to get a hold of the fish on one or two occasions. Then your child will be able to follow the instructions to keep the fish inside, in the water, and so on, and hopefully when they are finished. The way you can do this with preschoolers is by gradually introducing the fish throughout the week, introducing them to the fish over time (starting as a group), and then slowly introducing them to the fish over time. As a parent, having a fish in your house can be as beneficial as having a fish in your backyard for children, and even more so when you are teaching preschoolers about how to swim.
When introducing a fish to your preschooler or kindergartner, there are a few things to keep in mind:
- Keep the size of the fish that you will be putting out with your child. With toddlers and preschoolers, it is easier for them to understand the difference between different sizes, even as they grow. Try to limit your little fish to small pieces to make the fish as small as possible.
- Have the child learn to hold the fish correctly. As long as your hands and feet are clean, the fish will not be able to hurt the fingers.
- Try to keep the fish as close to the floor as possible. This will help keep the fish from injuring the hands or other parts of the body.
- Don’t force a child to put down the fish. Many parents who don’t like fish will leave the fish in a big bag or a box. Be sure that your child understands that they can’t bring a big fish to an aquarium.
- If you have a large child, you might find the “how to” lesson from this article easier to follow. This may require your child to sit and have supervision just like any other small fish.
How can you use a fish in the home setting?
The best way to teach your little fish to be safe is to teach the rules of the fish. Some of the best rules are simple:
- Never feed your child food that is fish-enriched.
- Never give your"

19072,0,"Question: What are cats? Answer: Let's think step by step.
Answer: Cats have many names depending on the cat breed and cat habitat where they are found. Some species are considered purebred and some are considered substandard. Most cats are classified as either mixed (wildcat, wild dog, domestic cat), or purebred (wildcat, panda/kungaroo).
1. Which species is considered purebred
Fluid and Blood: The cats that have blood type A and B are considered the purebred cats. In fact, purebred cats can be seen in many types of cats ranging from toy rabbits to wild dogs. They are an important part of the human pet supply, providing both the domestic cat and its companion those that are not wild.
Wildcat and domestic cat: The Wildcat and domestic cat have much in common. They share many of the characteristics that make them one of the many types of cats. They typically have a distinctive head shape and large claws. Their long, narrow bodies and dense manes typically give them an animal-like appearance to look at, often accompanied with a strong, sharp, rounded jaw.

Question: How many cats are there? Answer: Let's think about this with you. There are eight different breeds of cats who are found in different parts of the country. Three of the breed are the Bengal, the Abyssinian and the Hottentot. Their colors can be easily separated.
Question: What is hair color and why do its so special? Answer: Well, this is where you'll find the mystery. Cats are colorless, so because they have such beautiful eyes, but they also have deep blue in the eye. This makes it very rare for the eyes of a cat to have such a blue in the eyes.

19072,2,"Question: What are cats? Answer: Let's think step by step. Cats are members of the feline family. A cat is any living member of the family of mammals. Cats have whiskers, eyes, and ears that can be used for sensing, smelling, eating, and feeling. Let's get a closer look. Cows, for example, can sense if they are pregnant or they are not. They also have large, sensitive scents. So, when a cat goes for a walk, her nose is probably full. That cat's scent is different from that of an animal. So, her body heat and scent would be more sensitive and it can have a very powerful impact in her mood.
As you can see, cats can smell like an animal. And the way a cat moves her body is more sensitive and the amount of information she can absorb. The way a cat's body moves is related to how quickly she gets used to the smell.
Cats smell in the environment.
Olfactory receptors, for instance, on the nose and mouth are located on the sides of the tongue, the roof of the mouth, and on the roof of the mouth. These receptors are sensitive to the smell and the chemicals that a cat needs. So"

There are more than 2 million different breeds of cats. Different breeds have a unique coat. The difference between them when it comes to coat colour alone is about the same as the colour of the dog.
This makes it very difficult for one person to identify the different colours of a dog. For instance, some breeds of dogs do not have a 'blue' coat and some are 'grey'.
Because the colour of the hair should always match the colour of the dog, these animals can all be considered 'wild' or 'wild'.<|endoftext|>As the sun sets on Thursday, the coldest winter of our lives has left snow on the ground: in a short period of time, we now know that the ground is frozen!
