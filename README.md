# GPT2 (124M)
# Key points
- In progress: Currently the model has been implemented and pretraining has completed (10B Tokens from finewebedu). Section 9 of "GPT2 (124M) - Andrej Karapathy.pdf" contain my next goals for this project. I plan to push this relatively small and simple model to it's limits. 
- The project implementation is found in "train_gpt2.py".
- Every single important implementation detail is explained in the code as comments.
- A general overview and my notes can be found in the "GPT2 (124M) - Andrej Karapathy.pdf" file. The sections 7 and onward are still in progress.
